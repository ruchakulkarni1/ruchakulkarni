                I am a graduate student from Portland State University with a M.S. in Computer Science. 
                I have had the opportunity to gain industry experience in software development where Iâ€™ve 
                applied the skills I have learned in my previous degree. 
                I like to code so in my free time, I enjoy solving analytical problems and 
                learn new programming languages.</p>
